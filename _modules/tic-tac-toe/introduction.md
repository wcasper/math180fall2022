## Introduction

The game **Tic-tac-toe** is familiar to everyone and has its origins in ancient antiquity.
In fact, early variations of the game can be found on Egyptian roofing tiles dated back to $$1300$$ BC!

## Playing tic-tac-toe online

To play tic-tac-toe online, we will just use the Whiteboard feature in Zoom.
To start, follow these instructions.
1.  One person in your group should select **Share screen**, select **Whiteboard**, and then check that others can annotate on that whiteboard.
(Note: for some versions of Zoom the annotation feature may be disabled, depending on who is sharing.  Hopefully at least one person in the group can get it to work!)
2. Pick two people to play a game of Tic-tac-toe starting out.  Make sure to help remind anyone who might have forgotten how to play!  Also, every time you make a move, tell the group something new about yourself.
3. After the game is over, choose two new people to play the game.  Cycle through until everyone has had an opportunity to play.  These games should be quick!  Everyone should hopefully get the chance to play after about $$5$$ minutes.
4. After about $$5$$ minutes, follow the appropriate link below to a Google Document for your Group Number.  In the Google Document, your group will write down a single set of rules describing how to play tic-tac-toe.  You will have about $$10$$ minutes to complete the document.
