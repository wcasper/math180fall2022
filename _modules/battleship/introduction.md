## Introduction

Battleship is a world-famous game originating as a paper-and-pencil game around the time of World War I in the 1930's before being released in it's more familar modern form by Martin Bradley in the 60's.  Most likely, this is a game that you have played more than once when you were younger, though if you are like me then it's been a while!

In Battleship, opposing players secretly arrange their ships on a  grid.  Then the players alternate making guesses of the locations of their opponents ships, attempting to get enough *hits* to sink the enemy fleet.  Are there good strategies for where to place the ships?  What about strategies for picking locations to fire?  It's up to you to find out!
